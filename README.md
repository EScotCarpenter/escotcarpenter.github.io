## Projects
**[Washington State Health Outcome Rankings](https://github.com/EScotCarpenter/washington-state-health-outcomes)**

Constructed in Jupyter Notebook and executed in Python, this project analyzed Health Outcome Rankings for all counties in Washington state from 2015 to 2023. It involved statistical hypothesis testing, building linear regression models to predict county health rankings, and constructing logistic regression models to determine feature weights for top rankings. Models were evaluated using random sampling cross-validation and visualized through ROC curves.

**[Worth a Shot: NBA Shot Analysis](https://github.com/EScotCarpenter/worth-a-shot-NBA-shot-analysis)**

Constructed and executed in R markdown, this project analyzed NBA shot data from 2003-2024, focusing on changes in shot selection. Using tidyverse and dplyr pipelines, dataframes were organized and summarized. Exploratory data analysis uncovered trends in scoring and field goal percentages by orientation and range. Expected values explained offensive shifts, and binomial simulations constructed samples for statistical tests.

**[Untwisting the Storm: Tornado Analysis](https://github.com/EScotCarpenter/untwisting-the-storm-tornado-analysis)**

Constructed and executed in R Quarto, this project analyzed tornado metrics, focusing on changes in reporting frequency, time, and location. Exploratory data analysis revealed an increased frequency of tornadoes, particularly within the EF0 category. An ANOVA test comparing different eras of tornado reporting found statistically significant results. A choropleth map visualized the varying frequencies of tornado reports.
